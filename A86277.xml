            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>MY bluſhing diſabilities have preſumed to ſalute you, unprovided of any other Ornament then ſincere Loyalty devoted to you: in this condition, I can ſay nothing of you, but what all men know, ſuch is the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of year <hi>Renowned Fame;</hi> ſuch is the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of your <hi>vertues</hi> and <hi>ſplendor</hi> of <hi>Learning,</hi> and frequent making of <hi>Acts,</hi> and giving of <hi>Laws</hi> with <hi>ſolid Prudence,</hi> and <hi>Elegant readineſs</hi> of <hi>Speaking</hi> and <hi>Writing; Knowledg</hi> of many <hi>things, Conſtant</hi> in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi> Aſſiſting the Poor in their Juſt Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and delivering the <hi>Impriſoned</hi> out of the hands of <hi>blood-thirſty Creditours:</hi> And theſe are the Commendable conditions with which you are endowed beyond the common cuſtom of others: I ſay nothing of thoſe Ancient Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of your eminent Nobility, the Treaſure of your Riches both old and new, the Large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your Spirit in Armes, with the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
<pb facs="tcp:170561:4"/>
whereof you excel, together with the comely form and ſtrength of the body: Though all theſe be very great, yet I eſteem you farr greater then all theſe, for thoſe your Heroick and ſuperilluſtrious vertues, by which you truly have cauſed, that by how much the more any one is Learned and loves vertue, ſo much the more he may deſire to inſinuate himſelf into your favour; whence I alſo am reſolv'd that your favour ſhall be obtained by me; but after the manner of the People of <hi>Italy</hi> (i. e.) not without a Preſent: which cuſtom of ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Princes, and men of honour is indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle,</hi> and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Greeciſts unto theſe very times, and ſtill we ſee it obſerved. And when I hear of certain Learned men to furniſh you with fair and great preſents of their Learning, leaſt I only ſhould be a Neglector of your Worſhip, I durſt not apply my ſelf with empty hands to your greatneſs. Now being thought full, amongſt the ſecrets of Nature, which I have laid up choice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and cloſely in my ſtudy with my other Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities, Behold, <hi>The Idea of the Law</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently offered it ſelf, as I attempted to Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter it when I followed the <hi>Practiſe</hi> of an <hi>Atturney</hi> in the <hi>Upper-Bench</hi> at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> &amp;c.

being almoſt paſt, I preſently made haſt, as it were to pay my vows, to preſent it to your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to compleat; Truly I was perſwaded that I could give nothing more acceptable to you, then a Method of this Nature, which none have, I dare ſay, hitherto attempted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore: Yet it is not writ to you, becauſe it is worthy of you; but that it might make a way open for me to gain your favour. I beſeech you if it may be, let it be excuſed by you: I ſhall be devoutly yours, <hi>If this part of Law</hi> ſhall by the Authority of your greatneſs come into Knowledg, envy being chaſed away, by the power of your Worthineſs; there remain the memory of it to me, as the Fruit of a good Conſcience; And ſo you ſhall know, that I ſhall all my Life be,</p>

                  <p>COncerning the Choyce of the Subject matter of my preſent Pains, It is the firſt of this race that ever was dedicated to any perſon, and had I not thought it the beſt, It ſhould have been taught a leſs ambition, then to chuſe ſuch a Princely Patron: I ſhall ſay no more, then that the ſole inducement thereto, was his ſingular learning in the Law and Goſpel; the former of which is ſo conſpicuous to the world, that it is univerſally acknowledged of all; and for the latter, there is none that can be ignorant thereof, who hath ever had the happineſs, though but in a ſmall meaſure of his own free and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Converſe. As for my own part, I cannot but publickly profeſs, I never read of any more wiſe and vertuous, and ſo truly and becomingly Religious, and where the right Knowledg of <hi>the Laws of God</hi> given to man, bears the enlightned mind ſo even, that it is as far from doing any wrong, as Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice it ſelf: And my preſent labours can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find better welcome, or more judicious
<pb facs="tcp:170561:6"/>
acceptance with any, then with ſuch as theſe; for ſuch free and unprejudiced ſpirits, will neither antiquate Truth for the oldneſs of the Notion, nor ſlight her for looking ſo young, or bearing the face of Novelty: He alone, above other men of honour, hath made goodneſs his Friend, as well as greatneſs his Companion; Beſides there are none that can be better aſſured of the ſincerity and efficacy of my preſent deſign, which is appointed to run through the midſt of the Laws of God and men; for as many as are not meer ſons of the Letter, know very well, how much the more inward and myſterious meaning of the <hi>Idea of the Law</hi> makes for the reverence of the holy Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore my deſign being ſo pious as it proves, I could do nothing more fit then to make choyce of ſo true a lover of the piety of the Law, as your ſelf, for a <hi>Patron</hi> of my preſent labours; eſpecially, you being ſo well able to do the moſt proper office of a Patron; to defend the Idea of the Laws and Statutes of <hi>England,</hi> that is here preſented to you, and to make up out of your rich treaſury of Learning, what my penury could not reach to, or inadvertency may have omitted: And truly if I may not hope this from you, I know not whence to
<pb facs="tcp:170561:6"/>
expect it: for I do not know where to meet with any ſo univerſally and fully accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the Law and Goſpel, and indeed in all parts of the choyceſt kind of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; any one of which acquiſitions is enough to fill, if not ſwell, an ordinary man with great conceit and pride, when as it is your ſole priviledg to have them all, and yet not to take upon you, nor to be any thing more Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious or Cenſorious of others, then they ought to be who know the leaſt: Theſe were the true conſiderations that direct me in the Dedication of this little treatiſe of the Law, which if you accordingly pleaſe to take into your favourable Patronage, and accept as a Monument or Remembrance of good will, You will oblige,</p>

                     <hi>THe Idea of the Law,</hi> is my preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; And firſt, I ſhall endeavour to follow the Method of God. Man, if you looke on his Material Parts, was taken out of the <hi>great World,</hi> as woman was taken out of man: You read in Geneſis, that God made him out of the Earth; This is a great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and you may find it in my book called, <hi>The Temple of Wiſdom.</hi> Now I refer you therefore thither, to avoid Repetitions; but now let me tell you in a word; it was not the common Pot-clay, but another thing, and that of a farr better Nature; He that knows this, knows the Subject of the <hi>Roſie Crucian</hi> Medicine, to procure long Life, <hi>Health, Youth, Riches,</hi> Wiſdome and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; how to alter, change and amend the ſtate of the body; as you may read in my three firſt Books which <hi>Elias Aſhmole</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquire, made publick, imperfect and rudely Deficient, calling it, <hi>The way to bliſs:</hi> In my true Copy of which, there are four Books, all wearing the ſame Title, except the laſt, which is called, <hi>The Roſie Crucian infallible

Axiomata;</hi> there you ſhal find what deſtroyes or preſerves the Temperament of Man.</p>
                  <p>I will in this Preface Digreſs, but not much from the purpoſe; becauſe I will ſhew you the Nature of man, how he fell, and wherefore Laws were given, &amp;c. Now in my Vacation I ſtudied Man; and in him I found three principles <hi>homogenial</hi> with his life, ſuch as can reſtore his decayes, and reduce his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders to a Harmony. They that are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in this point, are not Competent Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Life and Death; but Quacks, and ſuch as daube their follies and abominable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, and horid cheats upon every wall, poſt and piſſing place, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Learned <hi>Viridiamus</hi> calls this matter <hi>Multiplices Terrae particula ſingularis; if</hi> theſe words be well examined, you may po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſibly find it out: And ſo much for the Body; let me ſpeak a word of his Soul, which is an Eſſence not to be found in the Texture of the great World; and therefore meerly Divine and Supernatural. <hi>Tebelenus</hi> calls it <hi>Divini ſpiritus aura, &amp; vitae Divinae Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litus;</hi> He ſeems alſo to make the Creation of Man, a little Incarnation; as if God in this work had multiplied himſelf: <hi>Adam</hi> (ſaith he) received his ſoul, <hi>Ex admiranda ſingulari<expan>

fas fructificatione. St.</hi> Luke alſo tels you the ſame thing; for he makes <hi>Adam</hi> the Son of God; not in reſpect of the exteriour Act of Creation, but by way of Deſcent: And this St. <hi>Paul</hi> confirms in the words of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;</hi> for we alſo are his Generation. The ſoul of man conſiſts chiefly of two Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Ruach and Mephes; Inferiour and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour; The Superiour is Maſculine and Eternal; The Inferior Faeminine and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.

<pb facs="tcp:170561:9"/>
Myſterious <hi>Law</hi> of Marriage, both Spiritual and Natural; and how he ought to uſe a wife. Matrimony is no ordinary trivial buſineſs, but in a moderate ſence Sacramental: It is a viſible ſign of our inviſible union to Chriſt; which St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls a great Myſtery; and if the thing ſignified be ſo reverend, the ſignature is no <hi>ex tempore,</hi> contemptible Agent. When God had thus finiſhed his laſt and moſt excellent Creature, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed his reſidence in Eden, made him his Vice-Roy; and gave him a <hi>Law</hi> with full Iuriſdiction over all his works; that as the whole man conſiſted of body and ſpirit, ſo the Inferiour Earthly Creatures might be ſubject to the one, and the Superiour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Eſſences might miniſter to the other. But this Royalty continued not long; for preſently upon his preferment, there was a faction in the Heavenly <hi>Court,</hi> and the Angels ſcorning to attend this piece of clay, contrived how to get a <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> for to remove him: The firſt in this Plot was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and he got a Lattatat of <hi>Azazell,</hi> and a warrant from <hi>Hilel,</hi> and ſo goes about to nullifie, reverſe and violate, that which God had enacted; that ſo at once, like an Inferior <hi>Bailiffe,</hi> and his Dog, as they call him, he might over reach him and his Creature:
<pb facs="tcp:170561:9"/>

A Witch is a Rebel in Phyſicks, and a Rebel is a Witch in Politicks: the one Acts againſt Nature, the other againſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the Rule of it; but both are in league with the Divel, as the firſt father of Diſcord and Sorcery. Satan being thus ejected, as the condition of Reprobates is, became more hardned in his Reſolutions, and to bring his Malice about, arrives by permiſſion at <hi>Eden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here this old Serpent, cunningly aſſaulted or arreſted <hi>Adam</hi> with ſuch warrantable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as would ſurely make him believe all was well; and ſo pleaſ'd his faeminine part, which was now ſo invigorated with life, that the beſt news to her, would be tidings of a warrant to do any thing: Wherefore the Serpent deceitfully ſaid to the faeminized <hi>Adam;</hi> why are you ſo demure, and what makes you ſo bound up in ſpirit; Is it ſo indeed, that God has confined you to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey his Law, taken away your Liberty, and
<pb facs="tcp:170561:10"/>
forbidden you all things that you may take pleaſure in?</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Adam</hi> anſwered, ſaying; No, we are not forbidden any thing that the Divine life in us approves as good and pleaſant. We are only forbidden to feed on our own will, and to ſeek pleaſures apart and without the warrant of the will of God: for if our own will get head in us, we ſhall be Arreſted, and aſſuredly be carried into the priſon of Mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and there lye in the ſtate of death.</p>
                  <p>But <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> and his Dog, ſaid unto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam;</hi> Tuſh, this is but a Panick fear in you <hi>Adam;</hi> I warrant you, you ſhall not ſo ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dye as you conceit; be ruled by me. The only matter is this: God indeed loves to keep his Creatures under a <hi>Law;</hi> holding them in from ranging too farr, and reaching too high; but he knows very well, that if you break his <hi>Law,</hi> and but take your liberty with us; and ſatiate your ſelves freely with with your own will; your eyes will be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully opened, and you ſhall meet with a world of variety of Preſidents and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in things; ſo that you will grow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly wiſe, and like Gods, know all things whatſoever, both good and evill. Now the faeminine part in <hi>Adam,</hi> was ſo tickled with this deceiver, that the Concupiſcible
<pb facs="tcp:170561:10"/>
began to be ſo immoderate, as to reſolve to do any thing that may promote pleaſure and experience in things, and carried away by this <hi>warrant</hi> Adams will and reaſon, by his heedleſneſs and inadvertency: So that <hi>Adam</hi> was wholly reſolved to obey the power of this Writ, ſigned with a counterfeit mark ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording the various toyings and titillations of the laſcivious life of the whitle: no longer calling for God or taking any Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Divine Genius.</p>
                  <p>And when he had tyred himſelf with a rabble of toyes, and unfruitfull and unſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory devices, riſing from the devil, and the multifarious working of the <hi>Particles</hi> of his <hi>Vehicle,</hi> at laſt the eyes of his faculties were opened, and they perceived they were now naked; he having as yet neither the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Heavenly nature, nor the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But the Divine light in the Conſcience of <hi>Adam,</hi> perſued him and upbraided unto him the caſe he was in: And <hi>Adam</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged within himſelf how naked he was; having no Power, nor Ornaments, nor Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of his own, and yet that he had left his obedience and dependence upon God, and ſubmitted to the falſe feigned <hi>Latitat</hi> of that curſed <hi>Bayliffe</hi> and deceiver <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>And the <hi>Divine Judge</hi> charged all this Miſery and confuſion, that had thus over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken him, upon the following the <hi>Luſcious dictates of his will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Adam</hi> again excu'ſd himſelf within himſelf; that it was the vigour and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſity of that <hi>life in the vehicle,</hi> which God
<pb facs="tcp:170561:11"/>
himſelf implanted in it; whereby he miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caried the woman that God had given him.</p>
                  <p>And the <hi>Divine Judge</hi> ſpake in <hi>Adam</hi> concerning woman, What work hath ſhe made here but the woman in <hi>Adam</hi> excuſed her ſelf; for ſhe was beguiled by that grand deceiver <hi>Valifer</hi> the <hi>Bayliffe</hi> as <hi>Irictericus</hi> cals him: In this confuſion of mind was <hi>Adam</hi> by forſaking the <hi>Divine Judge,</hi> and letting his own will get head againſt it; for it ſo changed the Nature of his <hi>vehicle,</hi> that (whereas he might have continued in an <hi>Angelical</hi> and Aethereal condition, and his faeminine part been brought into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience to the Divine light, and had joyes multiplied upon the whole man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all Expreſſion and Imagination for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever) he now ſunk more and more, and by <hi>habeas corpus</hi> is carried towards a Mortal and Terreſtial Eſtate; himſelf not being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible thereof, as you ſhall hear when I have told you the <hi>Judgment</hi> of the Eternal <hi>God,</hi> concerning the Serpent and him.</p>
                  <p>Things therefore have been carried on in this wiſe; the Eternal Lord God decreed thus with himſelf concerning the Serpent and <hi>Adam:</hi> That this old Serpent, the Prince of the rebellious Angels, ſhould be more
<pb facs="tcp:170561:12"/>
accurſed then all the reſt: and (whereas he Lorded it aloft, in the higher parts of the Aire; and could glide in the very Ethereal Region, amongſt the innocent and unfaln Souls of men, and the good Genii before) that he ſhould now ſweep the duſt with his belly, being caſt lower towards the ſurface of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>And that there ſhould be a general enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty betwixt this old Serpent, as alſo all of his fellow Rebels, and betwixt mankind; and that in progreſs of time, the ever faithfull and obedient ſoul of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould take a body, and ſhould trample over the power of the devel, very notoriouſly here upon Earth: and after his death, ſhould give Rule and <hi>Superſede all mankind;</hi> being now conſtituted the Supreme and Principal Attorny, Counſellour and Prince of all the Angelical orders what ever in Heaven: And concerning <hi>Adam,</hi> the Eternal Lord God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that he ſhould indeed be <hi>removed</hi> down to the <hi>Earth,</hi> and that he ſhould not there indulge to himſelf the pleaſures of the body, without the Concomitants of Pain and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; and that his <hi>Faeminine</hi> part, his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhould be under the chaſtiſement of the Law of his Reaſon. That he ſhould have a weariſom and toylſom Labour an Travel in
<pb facs="tcp:170561:12"/>
this World; the Earth bringing forth thornes and thiſtles, though he muſt ſubſiſt by the corn of the field; wherefore in the ſweat of his brows, he ſhould eat his bread, till he retured unto the ground, of which his terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial body is made. This was the Counſel of God concerning <hi>Adam</hi> and the Serpent. Now as I was telling you, <hi>Adam</hi> though he was ſinking apace into th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe lower fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of life, yet his mind was not grown ſo fully ſtupid, but he had the knowledg of his own condition, and added to all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Apologies, that the <hi>Faeminine</hi> part in him though it had ſeduced him, yet there was ſome uſe of this Miſcariage; For the Earth would hence be inhabited by intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Animals; wherefore he called the life of his vehicle <hi>Eve;</hi> becauſe ſhe is indeed the Mother of the generations of men that live upon the Earth.</p>
                  <p>And at laſt the Plaſtick power being fully awakened, <hi>Adams</hi> ſoul was caſt into the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the prepared matter of the Earth; and in due proceſs of time, <hi>Adam</hi> appear'd cloath'd in the skin of Beaſts; That is, he became a down right Terreſtrial Animal, and a mortal creature upon Earth. For the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God had ſo decreed; and his <hi>Wiſdom, Mercy</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> did, but if I may ſo ſpeak,
<pb facs="tcp:170561:13"/>
play and ſport together in the buſineſs; and the rather becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> had but precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated himſelf into that condition, which in due time might have fallen to his ſhare by courſe; for it is fitting there ſhould be ſome ſuch head among the living creatures of the Earth as a <hi>terreſtrial Adam;</hi> but to live al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes here, were his diſavantage. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when God by <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> remov'd him from the higher condition, he made ſure he ſhould not be immortal; nor is he in any capacity of reaching unto the <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> without paſſing thorow his fiery <hi>Vehicle,</hi> and becomming a pure defaecate Ethereal Spirit: then he may be admitted to taſt the fruit of the tree of Life and Immortality, and ſo live for ever.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may reply, Seing that God made all things very good, as it appears in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of the Creatures on the ſixth day, how could it be a ſin in <hi>Adam,</hi> to eat that which in it ſelfe was good? Verily, the ſin was not grounded in the nature of that which he did eat, but it was the infringement of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, in as much as he was forbidden to eat it. And this is that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, that he had not known ſin, had it not been <hi>for the Law;</hi> And again in another place, the ſtrength of ſin <hi>is the Law:</hi> but
<pb facs="tcp:170561:13"/>
preſently upon the <hi>diſobedience</hi> of the firſt man and his tranſgreſſion of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Creature was made ſubject to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: for the curſe as you heard followed, and the impure ſeeds were joyned with the pure, and they reign to this hower in our bodies.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Chriſt hath nonſuited the Devil,</hi> and taken Judgment and Execution againſt him, and ſet man at liberty; his ſoul being now ſatisfied with nothing but God, from whom at firſt ſhe was removed; in the body, ſhe is in dirt and mire; out of the body in a trice ſhe is above the Moon.</p>

                  <p>When good to go to Law, when good to marry; and finally it reſolveth all manner of queſtions; but if any happen to converſe with Angels, and be acquainted with <hi>Roſie Crucians</hi> that dayly ſend theſe Genii abroad in the world, let him not Arrogate any thing to himſelf, becauſe of his preſent Power, but be contented with that which his <hi>Genius</hi> ſhall ſay unto him; praiſe God perpetually for this <hi>familiar Spirit;</hi> and have a ſpecial care that it is not uſed for any worldly pride, but imploy it in ſuch works which
<pb facs="tcp:170561:18"/>
are contrary to the world, uſe it rightly, and enjoy it as he that hath it not; live a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate life, and beware of all ſin, otherwiſe my friend you Genius will forſake you, and you ſhall be deprived of happineſs; for know this of a truth, whoſoever abuſeth this <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and lives not exemplarily, purely and devoutly before men, he ſhall loſe this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and ſcarce any hope will there be left ever to recover it afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Genii</hi> teach and give Laws to the <hi>Servants of God,</hi> for to deliver to the people. Theſe Genii command us to forgive our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and regard not any that ſpeak evil againſt us: for what hath a good man to do with the dull approbation of the vulgar? Fame like a River, bears up all light things and ſwolne, but drowns things weighty and ſolid: I ſee the loweſt vertues draw praiſe from the common people; the middle ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues work in them Aſtoniſhment; but of the higheſt vertues they have no ſence or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivance at all.</p>
                  <p>Regard not therefore vaine praiſes, for praiſe proceeds more out of bravery, then out of merit and happineſs; rather to vain and windy Perſons, then to perſons ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and ſolid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:170561:19"/>My <hi>Genius</hi> hath had ſome conteſt with mee in the diſpoſal of <hi>The Idea of the Law,</hi> the ſubject being croſs to the <hi>deceit</hi> of the times, which is both malicious, corrupt and ſpleenatick; it was my deſire to keep it within doors, but the relation it bears to my former diſcourſes and my practice, hath forced it to the Preſs; it is the laſt glaſs of my thoughts, and their firſt reflex being not compleat, I have added this to perfect their Image and ſimmetry, hoping it will be profitable. The Genius of the Law of <hi>England</hi> and of the City of <hi>London,</hi> is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the ſame that <hi>King Charles</hi> hath, who is called <hi>King of Scots;</hi> and there is no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that will be eſtabliſhed with good and wholſome Laws, but <hi>Monarchy;</hi> who can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate Fire and Water? The people will not be happy without the <hi>King</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it is eſteemed more <hi>Honour, Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency</hi> and <hi>Majeſty</hi> amongſt the <hi>Legitimate Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry of the world, for a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to reſtore or make a King, then to be a King, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My humble and hearty deſire is, that the Laws of England, the Priviledges of Parliament, the Liberty of the Subject, and the property of all things, may be aſſerted according to the firſt Declarations of the
<pb facs="tcp:170561:19"/>
King and Parliament, in the begining of the unfortunate Warr.</p>
                  <p>That the true Proteſtant Religion in the beſt ſence of the Church of <hi>England</hi> may be profeſſed and defended, all Hereſies, Sects and Schiſmes diſcountenanced and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, a lawfull ſucceſſion of godly and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Miniſters continued and encouraged, and the two Univerſities, <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and all Colleges in both of them may be preſerved and countenanced: And this is for the proſperity of the Nation.</p>
                  <p>I have now done, Gentlemen, but how much to my own prejudice I cannot tell; I hope I have offended no man, yet I am confident this ſhall not paſs without noiſe; but if I have err'd in any thing, (and yet I have followed the beſt <hi>preſidents</hi> of <hi>Lawyers</hi> in the World) I expoſe it not to the mercy of man, but of God, who as he is moſt able, ſo alſo he is moſt willing to forgive in the day of our account.</p>
                  <p>And if any more zealous Pretenders to Prudence, Policy and Piety, ſhall oppoſe the <hi>Idea of the Law,</hi> I ſhall expect from them theſe following performances:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A plain poſitive Expoſition of all the paſſages in this Book, without any injury to the ſence of their <hi>Authour;</hi> for if they
<pb facs="tcp:170561:20"/>
interpret them otherwiſe then they ought, they but create Errors of their own, and then overthrow them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To prove their Familiarity with the <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>Idea of the Law,</hi> and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in theſe Divine and Natural Statutes; let them give the Reader a punctual diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of all the ſecrets thereof. If this be more then they can do, it is argument enough that they know not what they oppoſe; and if they do not know, how can they Judg? or if they judge, where is their Evidence to Condemn?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let them not mangle and diſcompoſe my Book with a ſcatter of obſervations, but proceed Methodically to the cenſure of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologue, Book, and the account at the end, expounding what is obſcure, and diſcovering the very intents of my Book, in promoting the practice of good Laws, for the benefit of my Country; that the reader may find (if I write for any other end then to diſabuſe the Nation) my poſitions to be falſe, not only in their Theory, but if he will aſſay it, by his own particular experience.</p>
                  <p>I intreat all <hi>Ingenuous Gentlemen,</hi> that they will not ſlight my <hi>Endeavours</hi> becauſe of my years, which are but few; it is the cuſtome of moſt men, to meaſure knowledg by the
<pb facs="tcp:170561:20"/>
Beard; but look rather on the Soul, an Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of that Nature <hi>quae ad perfectionem ſuam curricula temporis non deſiderat:</hi> and that they would not conclude any thing raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt me.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I Publiſhed that knowledg which God gave me, <hi>Ad fructum bonae Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiae;</hi> I have not buſhell'd my Light, nor buried my Talent in the ground. I will now whilſt the poor Communalty are Plaintiffs, and Exrciſe-men Defendants, humbly move for the Plaintiffs, and put up my <hi>Idea of the Law</hi> to the Judg, and ſo let the Attorney and his Counſel on the other ſide, ſhew cauſe why we may not have judgment againſt them; the Devil being Nonſuited, and my Council hath put all his enemies under his feet, Sentence being given, I humbly pray the Execution may be ſerved upon the laſt Enemy; that my <hi>Counſellor, Judg, Prince</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> may deliver up the <hi>Kingdom</hi> to his Father: For now is nothing covered that ſhall not be revealed, and hid that ſhall not be known.</p>

The <hi>Authority of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates</hi> depends upon the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> and the forme of Policy, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Lawes Fundamental: Wherefore if this Government be good, ſound, and healthfull, Lawes will be to good
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170561:31"/>
purpoſe: If otherwiſe, there will be little ſecurity in them.</p>
                  <p>Yet notwithſtanding, the end of Publique Law is not only to be a guardian to private right, leſt that ſhould any way be violated, or to repreſs Injuries, but it is extended alſo, unto Religion, and Armes, and Diſcipline, and Ornaments, and Wealth. Finally, to all things which any way conduce unto the proſperous eſtate of a Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. For the end and aim at which Lawes ſhould level, and whereto they ſhould direct their Decrees and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, is no other than this, That the people may live happily: This will be brought to paſs, if they be rightly train'd up in Piety, and Religion, if they be honeſt for moral converſation, ſecur'd by Armes againſt Forraign E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, munited by Lawes againſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and private wrongs: Obedient to Government and Magiſtrates: Rich
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170561:32"/>
and flouriſhing in Forces and wealth: But the Inſtruments and Sinnes of all bleſſings are Lawes.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. And to this end, the Lawes we receiv'd ſucceſſively, by <hi>Moſes,</hi> were firſt from God, and then from him by <hi>Joſuah,</hi> and from <hi>Joſhua</hi> by the 70 Elders, &amp;c. But the beſt Lawes we received from Chriſt, the Apoſtles delivered them to the Biſhops, &amp;c. And the end they attain, you read before: But many Lawes miſs this mark: For there is great difference and a wilde diſtance in the compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive value and virtue of Lawes: For ſome Lawes are excellent, ſome of a middle temper, others altogether corrupt. I will exhibite, according to the meaſure of my Judgment ſome certain Lawes (as it were) of Lawes, whereby Information may be taken, what in all Lawes is well or ill received by Maſſora, and eſtabliſhed, or by Tradition tinctur'd with the virtue or vice of the Judges, and their Brethren.</p>
                  <p n="41">
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:170561:32"/>41. But before I deſcend to the Body of Lawes in particular, I will briefly write the Merit and Excellency of Lawes in general: A Law may be held good, that is certain in the Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, juſt in the Precept, profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the Execution, Agreeing with the Form of Government, in the preſent State, and begetting virtue in thoſe that live under them.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. Certainty is ſo Eſſential to a Law, as, without it a Law cannot be juſt, <hi>Si enim incertam vocem det Tuba, quis ſe parabit ad Bellum:</hi> So, if the Law give an uncertain ſound, who ſhall prepare himſelf to obey: A law muſt give warning before it ſtrike: And you do not read, that <hi>Cain</hi> killed any after God had marked him: and it is a good Preſident, That is the beſt Law which gives leaſt Liberty to the Arbitrage of the Judg (and that is the reaſon of <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſtrict charge to the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170561:33"/>
people, that they ſhould not come nigh the Mountain) which is that the certainty thereof effecteth.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. Incertainty of Lawes is of two ſorts, One, where no Law is preſcribed: The other, when a Law is difficile and Dark: I muſt therefore firſt ſpeak of Cauſes omitted in the Law, that in theſe likewiſe there may be found ſome Preſident of certainty.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. The narrow compaſs of man's wiſdome cannot comprehend all Caſes which time hath found out: and therefore New Caſes do often preſent themſelves. In theſe Caſes there is applyed a threefold Remedy or Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, either by a Proceeding upon like Caſes, or by the uſe of Examples, though they be not grown up into Law, or by Juriſdictions, which award, according to the Arbitrement of ſome Good Man, <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Chriſt;</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:170561:33"/>
as you may read in the Old and New Teſtament, how Controverſies were decided, according to ſound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether in Courts Pretorian, or of Equity, or Courts Cenſorian, or of Penalty.</p>
                  <p n="45">45. In new Caſes your Rule of Law is to be deduced from Caſes of like nature, but with Caution and Judgment, touching which theſe Rules following are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: Let Reaſon be fruitfull, and Cuſtome be barren, and not breed new Caſes; Wherefore, whatſoever is accepted againſt the ſence and Reaſon of a Law: or elſe, where the Reaſon thereof is not apparent, the ſame muſt not be drawn into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>
                  <p n="46">46. A ſingular publick Good doth neceſſarily introduce Caſes pretermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; Wherefore, when a Law doth notably and extraordinarily reſpect,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170561:34"/>
and procure the Profit and Advantage of a State. Let their Interpretation be ample and extenſive. It is a hard caſe to torture Laws, that they may torture men: I would not therefore that Lawes penal, much leſs capital, ſhould be extended to new Offences: Yet, if it be an old Crime, and known to the Lawes, but the Proſecution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of falls upon a new Caſe, not foreſeen by the Lawes, You muſt, by all means depart from the Placits of Law, rather than that offences paſs unpuniſh'd.</p>
                  <p n="47">47. In thoſe Statutes which the Common Law (eſpecially concerning Caſes frequently incident, and are of long continuance) doth abſolutely repeal, I like not the Proceeding by Similitude unto New Caſes: For, when a State hath for a long time wanted a whole Law, and that, in caſes expreſs'd, there is no great danger, if the Caſes omitted expect a Remedy by a New Statute.</p>
                  <p n="48">
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:170561:34"/>48. Such Conſtitutions as were manifeſtly the Lawes of time, and ſprung up from emergent Occaſions then prevailing in the Kingdome: I think now it is called ſo by <hi>Carolus Magnus ſecundus,</hi> The State oft times now changed, they are reverenc'd enough, if they may conſerve their Authority within the limits of their own proper Caſes: And it were monſtrouſly prepoſterous any way to extend and apply them to Caſes omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as in <hi>Olivers</hi> time.</p>
                  <p n="49">49. There can be no Sequel of a Sequele: but the extention muſt be arreſted within the Limits of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Caſes, otherwiſe you fall by degrees upon unreſembling Caſes, and the Subtilty of wit will be of more force than the Authority of Law.</p>
                  <p n="50">50. In Lawes and Statutes of a compendious Stile, extention may be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170561:35"/>
made more freely: But in thoſe Lawes which are punctual in the Enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Caſes particular, more warily; For, as exception ſtrengthens the force of a Law, in caſes not excepted, ſo enumeration weakens it, in caſes not enumerated.</p>
                  <p n="51">51. An explanatory Statute damms up the ſtreams of a former Statute; neither is the Extention received af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, in the one or the other: For there is no Superextention can be made by a Judg, where once an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath begun to be made by a Law.</p>
                  <p n="52">52. The Forme of words and Acts of Court doth not admit an Extention upon like Caſes; for that looſeth the nature of Formality, which departs from Cuſtome to Arbitriment; And the Introduction of <hi>Olivers</hi> Tyranical new Heavy Caſes imbaſeth the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and cloggs the purity of the late Sacred <hi>King Charles</hi> his Statutes.</p>
                  <p n="53">
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:170561:35"/>53. Extention of Law is aptly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed unto caſes <hi>Poſt nate,</hi> which were not exiſtent in Nature, when the Law was enacted: For, where the Caſe could not be expreſt, becauſe there were not ſuch extant, a Caſe omitted is accepted for a Caſe expreſt, if the reaſon be the ſame: So for extention of Lawes in Caſes amiſs, let this my Direction ſuffice: Now I ſhall ſpeak of the uſe of Examples.</p>
                  <p n="53">53. It follows now I ſpeak of Examples from which Right is inferr'd, where Law is imperfect: As for Cuſtome, which is a kinde of Law; and for Preſidents, which by frequent Practice are grown into Cuſtome, as into a Tacite Law, I will ſpeak in due place: But now I ſpeak of Examples or Preſidents which rarely and ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly fall out, and are not yet grown up to the ſtrength of a Law, namely, when, and with what caution a Rule of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170561:36"/>
Law is to be derived from them where Law is imperfect.</p>
                  <p n="54">54. Your Preſidents muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> King <hi>Charles,</hi> and his happy Son, being good and moderate: and not from the <hi>bloudy Factions, or diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Times</hi> of the Tyrant <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> and his Sons; For Examples fetched from ſuch times are a Baſtard Iſſue, and do rather corrupt than inſtruct.</p>
                  <p n="55">55. In his late <hi>Sacred Majeſties</hi> time, the Examples are to be reputed the beſt, and moſt ſafe; for thoſe were but lately done, and no inconveniences enſued: Now, Why may it not be done again? Yet nevertheleſs recent Examples are of leſs Authority, and if perchance it ſo fall out, that a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, Modern Preſidents taſte more of their own times, than of right Reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="56">
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:170561:36"/>56. But thoſe Preſidents betwixt Chriſt his Apoſtles, and the late King <hi>Charles</hi> muſt be received with caution, and choice. For, ſince our Saviour Chriſt two hundred years, the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of an Age altered many things; ſo as, what might ſeeme <hi>ancient</hi> for <hi>time,</hi> the ſame, through perturbation and Inconformity, to the preſent Age, may be altogether new: Wherefore leaving <hi>Moſes, Joſhua,</hi> and the Elders, and the ſucceeding Prophets to the Lawes and Statutes of their times, and following the Examples of Chriſt, his <hi>Apoſtles, Biſhops,</hi> and the <hi>Judges</hi> of a middle time are beſt; or of ſuch an Age as beſt ſorts with the preſent times, which now and than the time farther off better repreſents, than the time cloſe at hand.</p>
                  <p n="57">57. Keep your ſelves within, or rather on this ſide the limits of an Example, and by no means ſurpaſs
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170561:37"/>
thoſe bounds: For, where there is no Rule of Law, all ought to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd with Jealouſie: Wherefore here, as in obſcure caſes, follow that which is leaſt doubtfull.</p>
                  <p n="58">58. Beware of Fragments, and Compounds of Examples: and view the example entire, and every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſage thereof: For, if it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall and unreaſonable before a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Comprehenſion of the whole Law, to make a Judgment upon a part, or Paragraph thereof: much more ſhould this Rule hold in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, which, unleſs they be very ſquare and proper, are of doubtfull uſe and application.</p>
                  <p n="59">59. In Examples, it imports very much through what hands they have paſt, and have been tranſacted: For if they have gone currant with Clarks only, and Miniſters of Juſtice, from the courſe of ſome Courts, without
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170561:37"/>
any notice taken thereof by Superiour Counſellors, or with the Maſter of Errours, by the people they are to be rejected, and little to be eſteemed of: but, if they have been ſuch preciſe Preſidents or Counſellors of Eſtate, Judges, to Principal Courts, as that it muſt needs be, that they have been ſtrengthened by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>acite approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at leaſt of Judges; they carry the more reverence with them.</p>
                  <p n="60">60. Preſidents that have been pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd, however leſs practiſed, which being debated, and ventilitated by Diſcourſes and diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p n="61">61. Examples that refer to Lawes I would not have them drawn from
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170561:38"/>
Writers of Hiſtory, but from publique Acts, and more diligent <hi>Traditions:</hi> The Hebrew word is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Kibbel,</hi> and it is an Infelicity familiar, even with the beſt Hyſtorians, that they paſs over Lawes, and Judicial Proceedings too ſlightly: and, if perhaps they have uſed ſome Diligence therein, yet they vary much from the authentick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions.</p>
                  <p n="62">62. An Example which a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Age, or a time neareſt unto it hath repealed, ſhould not eaſily be taken up again, though the like Caſe ſhould afterwards enſue: nor makes it ſo much for an Example, that upon Experience they have now relinquiſh'd it.</p>
                  <p n="63">63. Examples are admitted into Councils, but do in like manner preſcribe or command: Therefore I adviſe you to let them bee ſo mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, that the Authority of the time
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170561:38"/>
paſt, may be bowed and plied to the practice of the time preſent; and thus much concerning Advice, and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, from Preſidents; where Law is imperfect: it followes next, that I ſpeak of Courts <hi>Pretorian</hi> and <hi>Ceufori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an:</hi> Courts of equity, and of penalty, as I practiſed of Cliffords Inn, where I was ſometime a Clerk.</p>
                  <p n="64">64. I adviſe you let there be Courts and Juriſdictions, which may define ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Arbitrement of ſome good man, and according to ſound Judgment for the Law, (as is obſerv'd before) cannot provide for all caſes, but is fitted to ſuch occurrences as commonly fall out; and time (as was ſaid by the Ancients) is a moſt wiſe thing, and daily the Author and Inventor of new caſes.</p>
                  <p n="65">65. New caſes fall out both in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Criminal, which have need of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, and in matters Civil, which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170561:39"/>
have need of reliefe, the Courts which reſpect the former, I call <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorian:</hi> which reſpect the latter <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="66">66. I adviſe you to let the <hi>Cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Courts of Juſtice have Juridiction and Power not only of puniſhing new offences, but alſo of increaſing penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties aſſigned by the Laws for old crimes, if the be caſes heinous, &amp; enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous; ſo they be not <hi>Capital,</hi> for a notorious guilt, is as it were, a new caſe.</p>
                  <p n="67">67. Obſerve alſo to let, in like manner, the <hi>Pretorian Courts of equity</hi> have power to quallify the rigor of <hi>Law,</hi> that none be impriſoned but thoſe taht are able to pay their debts: their goods &amp; chattels ought not to be engaged, but at the diſcreation of ſome good man: let time given be for payment, for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the defects of Law; for if a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170561:39"/>
ought to be extended to him whom the Law hath paſt by, much more to him whom it hath wounded.</p>
                  <p n="68">68. Take care that theſe <hi>Cenſorian</hi> and <hi>Praetorian</hi> Courts be by all means limited within caſes extraordinary, not invade ordinary Juridictions, leaſt peradventure the matter extend to the ſupplantation, rather than the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of Law.</p>
                  <p n="69">69. Let theſe Juridictions reſide on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the higheſt Courts of Judicature, and not be communicated to courts Inferiour: for the power of extending, or ſupplying or moderating Laws, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle differs from the power of making them.</p>
                  <p n="70">70. But let not theſe Courts be aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over to one man, but conſiſt of many: nor let the decrees thereof iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue forth with ſilence, but let the <hi>Judges</hi> alledg reaſons of their ſentence
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170561:40"/>
and that openly in the Audience of the Court, that which is free in the power, may in the fame and reputation be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined.</p>
                  <p n="71">71. Let their be no rubriques of blood, neither define of Capital crims, in what Court ſoever, but from a known and certain Law: for God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf firſt denounced death, afterwards inflicted it; nor is any man to be put to death, but he that knew beforehand that he ſinned againſt his own life.</p>
                  <p n="72">72. In Courts of Cenſure, give way to a third tryal, that a neceſſity be not impoſed upon Judges of abſolving, or of condemning, but that they may pronounce a <hi>non Liquet;</hi> ſo in like manner, let Laws <hi>Cenſorian,</hi> not only be a <hi>penalty</hi> but an infamy that is, which may not inflict a puniſhment, but either end in admoniſion; or elſe chaſtiſe the delinquet with ſome light touch of Ignominy, and as it were
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170561:40"/>
a bluſhing ſhame.</p>
                  <p n="73">73. <hi>In Cenſorian Courts</hi> let the firſt aggreſſions, and the middle <hi>Acts</hi> of great offences, and wicked attempts be puniſh't: yea although they were never perfectly accompliſh't: and let that be the cheifeſt uſe of thoſe <hi>Courts,</hi> ſeeing it appertaines to ſeverity, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the firſt approaches of wicked en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes, And to <hi>Mercy</hi> to intercept the perpetration of them by correcting middle Acts.</p>
                  <p n="74">74. Special regard muſt be taken, that in <hi>Pretorian Courts,</hi> ſuch caſes be not countenanced, which the Law hath not ſo much pretermitted, as ſlighted as frevilous or as odious, Judg'd unworthy redreſs.</p>
                  <p n="75">75. Above all, it moſt imports the certainty of Laws, that Courts of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity do not ſo ſwell and overflow their banks, as under prtence of mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigating
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170561:41"/>
the rigour of Laws, they do diſſert or relaxe the ſtrength and ſinnes thereof, by drawing all to Arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p n="76">76. I adviſe you not to let Pretori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Courts have power to decree againſt expreſs Statutes, under any Pretence of equity, for if this ſhould be permitted, a Law Interpreter would become a Law maker, and all matters ſhould depend upon Arbitrement.</p>
                  <p>The Recorder of London; is of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, That the Juriſdiction of defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning according to equity and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and that other, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſtrict Law, ſhould be deputed to the ſame Courts: but <hi>Judg Rolle</hi> ſayes to ſeveral, by all meanes let there be a ſeperation of Courts, for there will be no diſtinction of Caſes, where there is commixtion of Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions: but you ſhall have Arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment incroach upon, and at laſt, ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up Law.</p>

                  <p n="83">83. Obſcurity of Laws ſpring from four cauſes: either from the exceſſive accumulation of Laws, ſpecially where there is a mixture of obſolete Laws; or from an ambiguous, or not ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous and delucide deſcription of Laws: or from the manner of expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Law, either altogether neglected, or not rightly purſued: or laſtly, from contradiction and incertainty of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</p>

The Prophetical Law-giver ſaith, <hi>Pluet ſuper eos Laqueos,</hi> now there are no worſe ſnares than the ſnares of Laws ſpecially penal, if they be immenſe for number; and through the alterations of times unprofitable; they do not preſent a torch, but ſpread a net to our feet.</p>
                  <p n="85">85. There are two wayes in uſe of making a new Statute, the one eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſheth and ſtrengthens the former Statute about the ſame Ject: and then adds and changes ſomething; the other abrogates and cancels what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed before, and ſubſtitutes <hi>de inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro,</hi> a new and uniforme Law, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way I approve: for by the former way Decrees become complicate and perplext; yet what is undertaken is indeed purſued: but the body of Law is the mean time corrupted; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the more diligence is required in the latter where the deliberation is

Now let there not be too ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous and anxious pains taken in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling contrary Titles of Law, and of Salving (as Mr <hi>Phillip Green</hi> terms it) all points by ſubtil and Studie Diſtinctions, for this is the web of wit, and however it may carry a ſhew of modeſty and reverence, yet it is to be reckoned in the number of things prejudicial, and being that which makes the whole body of Law ill ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and incoherent; it were far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the worſt Titles were cancell'd, and the reſt ſtand in force.</p>
                  <p n="88">88. I adviſe you to let ſuch Lawes as are obſolete or growen out of uſe, as well as Anti-nomies, be propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by delegates as a part of their charg to be repeall'd: for ſeeing expreſs Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute cannot regurarly be voyded by Diſuſe, it fals out that through a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimation of Old Laws, the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the reſt is ſomewhat embaſed:

And the <hi>Cromwells</hi> Tyrannical Torture enſues, that Lawes alive are murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deſtroyed in the feare of God, with the deceitfull imbracements of Lawes dead: But above all beware of a Gangreen in Lawes.</p>
                  <p n="89">89. For ſuch Lawes as are not late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly publiſhed let the <hi>Pretorian Courts</hi> have power, in the mean ſpace, to define centrary to them; for although it hath been ſaid, not impertinently, No man ought to make himſelf wiſer then the Lawes: yet this may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of Lawes, when they are awake, not when they are aſleep: on the other ſide let not the more recent Statutes, which are found prejudicial to the Law publique be in the power of the Judges, but in the power of the King and the Counſellors of Eſtate, and ſupreem Authorities for redreſs, by ſuſpending their execution through Edicts and Acts, until Parliamentary Courts, and ſuch High Aſſemblies

If Lawes accumulated upon Lawes, ſwell into ſuch vaſt volumes, or be obnoctious to ſuch confuſion, that it is expedient to reviſe them a new, and to reduce them into a ſound and ſolid body, intend it by all means and let ſuch a work be reputed an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicall noble work: and let the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſuch a work, be rightly and deſervedly ranckt in the number of <hi>The Right Worſh.</hi> Ralph Gardener, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>

                  <p n="92">92. And it will import very much for uſe, to compoſe and ſort apart in a new Digeſt of Laws, Law recepted for Common Law, which in regard of their beginning are time out of mind, And on the other ſide, Statutes ſuper-added from time to time: ſeeing in the delivery of a Juridical ſentence the Interpretation of Common Law, and Statute Laws, in many points is not the ſame: This <hi>Judg Roll.</hi>

                  <p n="93">93. But in this Regeneration and new Structure of Laws, retain preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Words and the Text of the Ancient Laws, and of the Books of Law, though it muſt needs fall out that ſuch Collection muſt be made by Centoes and ſmaller portions: then ſort them in order: for although this might have been performed more apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and (if you reſpect right reaſon) more truely, by a new Text, than by ſuch a Conſarcination, yet in Laws, not ſo much the Stile and Deſcription, as Authority, and the Patron thereof, Antiquity, you muſt carefully obſerve, otherwiſe ſuch a work might ſeem a Scholaſtick buſineſs, and Method, rather than a body of Commanding Laws.</p>
                  <p n="94">94. In this new Method of Laws, upon good advertiſement a Caveat hath been put in; that the Ancient
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170561:47"/>
volumes of Law ſhall be utterly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht, and periſh in oblivion, but at leaſt remain in Libraries, though the common and promiſcuous uſe thereof might be retained; for in Caſes of weighty conſequence, it will not be amiſs to conſult and look into the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and continuation of Laws paſt: and indeed it is uſually to ſprinckle mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern matters with Antiquity, and this new body of Law muſt be confirmed only by ſuch, who in every State have the power of making Laws, leaſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance under colour of digeſting An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Laws, new Laws under hand be conveyed in.</p>
                  <p n="95">95. I could wiſh that this <hi>Idea</hi> of Laws might be <hi>Peruſed, Practiſed, and Exalted,</hi> in the underſtanding of <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and Wiſe men:</hi> in ſuch times as now when <hi>Philoſophy, Reaſon, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and <hi>Experience,</hi> excels thoſe more Ancient times, whoſe Acts and Deeds they recognize: which fell out other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

Thus have I ſhewed you the obſcurity of Laws ariſing from the exceſſive and confuſed accumulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof: I ſhall next ſpeak of the dark and doubtfull deſcription of them.</p>
                  <p n="96">96. Obſcure deſcription of Laws ariſe either from the Loquacity o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Verboſity of them; or again, from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream brevity, or from the preamble of a Law repugnant with the body of a Law.</p>
                  <p n="97">97. I ſhall now inſtruct you how to enlighten the obſcurity of Law, ariſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a corrupt and crooked deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof. The Loquacity and Prolixity, which hath been uſed in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170561:48"/>
ſetting down Laws I diſlike: neither doth ſuch a writer any way compaſs what he deſires, and labours for, but rather the quite contrary: For, while a man endeavors to purſue and expreſs every particular caſe in apt and proper tearms, hoping to gain more certitude thereby, contrary-wiſe it fals out that through many words, multitude of Queſtions are engendred: ſo as more ſound and ſolid interpretation of Law according to the genuine ſence and mind thereof is much intercepted through the noiſe of words.</p>
                  <p n="98">98. And yet notwithſtanding a too conciſe and affected brevity for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties ſake, or as more imperial, is not therefore to be approved ſpecially in theſe times, leaſt Law become per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance a Lesbian Rule: wherefore a middle temper'd ſtile is to be imbraced: and a generallity of words well ſtated to be ſought out; which though it do
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170561:49"/>
not ſo throughly purſue Caſes compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, yet it excludes Caſes not comprehended deerly enough.</p>
                  <p n="99">99. Yet in ordinary and politick Laws and Edicts, wherein for moſt part no man adviſeth with his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil, but truſteth to his own Judgment, all ſhall be more amply explicated and pointed out, as it were with the finger, even to the meaneſt Capacity.</p>
                  <p n="100">100. So neither ſhould I allow of preambles to Laws which amongſt the Ancients were held impertinencies, and which introduce diſputing and not Commanding Laws: If I could well away with Ancient cuſtomes: But theſe prefaces commonly (as the times are now) are neceſſary prefixt, not ſo much for explication of Law, as for perſwaſion that ſuch a Law, may paſs in the ſolemn meeting of a State, and again to give ſatisfaction to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munalty, yet ſo far as poſſible may be,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170561:49"/>
let Prologues be avoided and the Law begin with a Command.</p>
                  <p n="101">101. The mind and meaning of a Law though ſometimes it may be drawn not improperly from <hi>Prefaces and Preambles,</hi> (as they term them) yet the Latitude and Extention there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of muſt not be fetcht from thence, for a Preamble by way of Example, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fetcheth in, Layes hold upon ſome of the moſt plauſible and moſt ſpecious paſſages; when yet the Law compriſeth many more: or on the contrary, the Law reſtraines and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits many Caſes, the reaſon of which limitations to inſert in the preface were ſuperfluous, wherefore the dimention and Latitude of a Law, muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the body of a Law: for a Preamble often fals either ſhort or over.</p>
                  <p n="102">102. And there is a very vitious manner of Recording of Laws, that is,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170561:50"/>
when the Caſe at which the Law aimeth, is expreſt at large in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble, afterwards from the force of the word (the like) or ſome ſuch term of relation, the body of a Law is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſt into the Preamble, ſo as the Preamble is inſerted and incorporated into the Law it ſelf, which is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure &amp; not ſo ſafe a courſe, becauſe the ſame diligence uſeth not to be taken in pondering and examining the works of a Preamble, as there uſeth to be done in the body of a Law it ſelf. Touching the incertainty of laws pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from an ill deſcription of them, I ſhall handle more at large hereafter, if this be acceptable: I ſhall next teach you how to expound Laws, and by what wayes.</p>
                  <p n="103">103. The wayes of expounding Law and Solving doubts are five: for this is done either by Court Rolls and Records, or by Authentique writs: or by Subſidiary books or by prelections,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170561:50"/>
or by reſponſes and reſolutions of wiſe men, all theſe if they be well inſtituted and ſet down, will be ſingular helps at hand againſt the obſcurity and errors of Laws.</p>
                  <p n="104">104. Now eſpecially above all, let the Judgments delivered in higher and principal Courts of Judicature, and in matters of grave importance, ſpecially dubious, and which have ſome difficulty and newneſs in them, be taken with faith and diligence: for Decrees are the Anchors of Law, as Laws are of the Republick.</p>
                  <p n="105">105. The manner of collecting ſuch Judgments and reporting them let this be, Regiſter the Caſe preciſely, the Judgments exactly; annex the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Judgments alleadged by the Judges, mingle not Authorities of caſes brought for example with ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes principal, as for perorations of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants, Counſellors,</hi> and <hi>Barreſters</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p n="108">108. I adviſe you to let the body of law be built only upon the laws them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves which conſtitutes the common-Law; next of Decrees or Statutes; in the third place of Judgments, enrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;

                  <p n="110">110 I adviſe you next, that you do not let the knowledg and practiſe of the Law be deſtituted, but rather be well provided with Auxiliary Books; they are in general ſix ſorts, Inſtitutes, of the ſignification of words; of the Rules of Law; Ancient Records Abridgments of Formes of Pleadings.</p>

The <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. In a word, <hi>Epiſcopacie</hi> will warrant the eaſie and familiar ſenſe that I ſhall ſet upon The <hi>Idea of the Law</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:170561:67"/>
in the literal meaning thereof, unto which if I adviſe, reaſons from the pious pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the holy <hi>Law-giver,</hi> ſhewing how every paſſage makes for greater Faith in <hi>God,</hi> and more affectionate obedience to his Law; there will be nothing wanting I think, (though I ſhall ſometimes caſt in ſome notable advantages alſo from Critical Learning) that may gain belief to the truth of the <hi>Kings Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>To prevent any further trouble in making good the ſenſe I have put upon <hi>Monarchy,</hi> being <hi>the beſt Form of Government in the world,</hi> for the advantage of the people, I ſhall here at once ſet down the <hi>Tyranny</hi> of the <hi>Times: in one example</hi> of the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Laws of <hi>Oliver Cromwell, and his fellows:</hi> How much like the <hi>Popes,</hi> their Laws and Statutes were, <hi>The late King Charles</hi> his Law, ſhewed the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween true and falſe, juſt and unjuſt, honeſt and diſhoneſt: But the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> boaſt, that they have the Laws laid up in the cheſt of their breaſt, to whom <hi>Will alone ſerveth for Law,</hi> with the Arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof they preſume to judge and rule all <hi>Sciences, Arts, Scriptures, Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and the works of men whatſoever they
<pb facs="tcp:170561:67"/>
be: For this cauſe <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi> ſtraightly commandeth all <hi>Chriſtian people,</hi> That no man in the <hi>Church</hi> ſhould preſume to judge any thing, nor any man, to juſtifie nor to diſcuſs any matter but by the authority of the <hi>holy Councils, Canons,</hi> and <hi>Decretals,</hi> whoſe head is the <hi>Pope:</hi> and alſo, that you cannot uſe the determination of the beſt learned men, of all the holyeſt Divines, but ſo far forth as the Pope doth permit, and ſhall authorize by his <hi>Canons:</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place the Canon doth forbid, that no other Volume or Book by the Divines, (yea throughout the whole world, ſaith he) but the ſame, which is allowed throughout the Romiſh Church by the <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Pope:</hi> The like Laws the Emperour pretended to have in <hi>Philoſophie, Phyſick,</hi> and other <hi>Sciences,</hi> granting no authority to any knowledge, but ſo much as is given them by the skilfulneſs of the <hi>Law,</hi> whereunto (as he ſaith) if all <hi>Sciences</hi> and <hi>Arts</hi> that are, be compared, they are all vile and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
                  <p>For this cauſe <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian</hi> ſaith, the Law is King of all things, both Humane and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, whoſe vertue is, (as <hi>Oramaſus</hi> ſaith) to command, to grant, to puniſh, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, then which dignities there is found no

Office more great: and <hi>Pomponius</hi> in the Laws, defineth, that it is the gift and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, and the determination of all wiſe men: becauſe theſe antient Law-makers, to the end they might purchaſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by their decrees among the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people, they made ſemblance that they did as they were taught by the Gods: As you may read in my <hi>Preface</hi> of this Book.</p>
                  <p>Behold now you perceive how the <hi>Popes</hi> Law preſumeth to bear ſway over all things, and exerciſeth <hi>Tyranny</hi> like <hi>O.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſerpers, Rebels</hi> and <hi>Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:</hi> which in the fear of God do <hi>Rob</hi> and <hi>Murther</hi> even their <hi>King,</hi> which things be of all others the weakeſt, and will be altered very ſuddenly by <hi>Charles</hi> his ſon.</p>
                  <p>The beginning of the ſin of our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents when they were arreſted, and carryed into fleſh, was the cauſe of all our miſeries. Now the Law of the Pope, <hi>O. Cromwell,</hi> and his fellows proceeded from <hi>Tyrannie</hi> and <hi>cruel uſurpation,</hi> whoſe notable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
<pb facs="tcp:170561:68"/>
are theſe; It is lawful to reſiſt force with force; he that breaketh promiſe with thee, break thou promiſe with him; it is no deceit to deceive him that deceiveth: a guileful perſon is not bound to a guileful perſon in any thing; blame, with blame, may be requited; Malefactors ought to rejoyce, if juſtice nor faithfulneſs. Injury is not done to him that is willing: It is lawful for them that traffique, to deceive one another: The thing is ſo much worthy as it may be ſold for: It is lawful for a man to provide for himſelf with the loſs of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: No man is bound to an impoſſible thing; when it muſt needs be that you or I be confounded, I ſhould chooſe rather that you be confounded then I; and many ſuch things, which afterwards were written among the <hi>Roman Laws:</hi> and now lately practiſed ſince <hi>King Charles</hi> the Firſt was <hi>murthered:</hi> Finally there is a Law, that no man ſhould <hi>die</hi> for thirſt, for hunger, for cold, or in Priſon for debt; nor be put in Priſon by his Creditor without <hi>ſix pence a day, and a penny loaf of bread, and two quarts of Ale every morning at eight of the clock.</hi> And if any be put <hi>in Priſon</hi> upon the <hi>Kings</hi> account, or at the <hi>Kings ſuit, he ought to be allowed two ſhillings ſix pence a day, and two bottles
<pb facs="tcp:170561:69"/>
of Wine;</hi> and the like Law ought to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by all <hi>Governours of Countries,</hi> and duly paid every Saturday at five of the clock at night. And no man is bound to hurt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by watching and labour. Afterwards the cruel Law of Nations aroſe, from whence war, murder, bondage were derived, and Dominions ſeparated: after this came the <hi>Civil,</hi> or <hi>Popular Laws,</hi> from whence have grown ſo many debates among men, that as the Laws do witneſs, there have been made more buſineſſes, then there be names of things; For, whereas men were prone and enclined to diſcord, the publiſhing of Juſtice, which was to be obſerved by means of the Laws was a neceſſary thing; to the end that the boldneſs of lewd men might in ſuch wiſe be bridled, and among the wicked inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency might be ſafe, and the honeſt might live quietly among the diſhoneſt: And theſe be the ſame ſo notable beginnings of the Law, wherein there have been innumerable Law-givers, of which <hi>Moſes</hi> was the firſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Civil Law is nothing elſe, but that which men will do with a common conſent, the authority of which is only in <hi>the King and the People:</hi> For without a <hi>King</hi> this is all void, and of none effect; for this cauſe

                     <hi>Pheroneus</hi> ſaith, that the Laws bind us for no other cauſe, but that they have been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the judgement of the King and People; wherefore if any thing pleaſe the People and the King, this then ſtandeth in force both by Cuſtom and Ordinances of Law: although there appear Error, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Error maketh Law, and the Matter judgeth Truth, which <hi>Ulpian</hi> a Tyrant, and a Lawyer in times paſt hath taught us in theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi> that he ought to be taken for a Free-man, of whom ſentence hath been given, although in effect he be a Libertine, (that is to ſay) a bond man made Free, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the matter judged is taken for Truth.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:170561:71"/>
and Rules of Chancery, ſo that there is no end nor meaſure of making Canons, which alone is the ambition and deſire of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> (that is to ſay,) to make new Canons, whoſe arrogancy is grown ſo far, that they have commanded the <hi>Genii</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> in Heaven, and have preſumed to rob and bring their booty out of <hi>Hell,</hi> and to put in their hands among the ſpirits of the dead: and on the Law of God alſo they have ſometimes exerciſed their Tyrannie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting, declaring, and diſputing, to the end that nothing might want, or be deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the greatneſs of his power.

<pb facs="tcp:170561:71"/>
intolerable Tymerity, I will not ſay Hereſie, the Schools of <hi>London</hi> in the Kings time openly deteſted and abhorred: But the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick Parliament</hi> intended very ſhortly, if <hi>Kings Charles the Second</hi> do not come the ſooner, to interrupt the <hi>Hyperbolical</hi> zeal of <hi>Clement</hi> with ſome <hi>Anabaptiſtical godly</hi> ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Invention, that the thing may rather flouriſh then periſh; ſeeing that for their affirming, or denying, nothing is altered in the deed and authority of the Pope, whoſe Canons and Decrees have in ſuch ſort bound all <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> and <hi>Presbyterie &amp;c.</hi> in a cord for Damnation, becauſe they deteſt the Popes Canons; and after this example they fear their own Clergy, ſo that none of all their Divines or Jeſuites, be he never ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantious, dareth to determine; no not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine or diſpute any thing contrary to the <hi>Popes Canons,</hi> without proteſtation and leave.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore we have learned out of theſe Canons, and Decrees, that the Patrimony of Chriſt, his Kingdoms, Caſtles, Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Foundations, Riches and Poſſeſſions, and that Empire and Rule, belongeth to the Biſhops and Prieſts of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to the Prelates of the Church, and the Juriſdiction and Temporal Power is the Sword of Chriſt; And that the Perſon of the <hi>Pope</hi> is the Rock,
<pb facs="tcp:170561:72"/>
being the foundation of the Church, that the Biſhops are not only the Miniſters of the the Church, but alſo Heads of the Church; and that Evangelical Doctrine, the fervency of Faith, the contempt of the world, are not only the goods of the Church, but Revenues, tenths, Offerings, collections, Purples, Mitres, Gold, Silver, Pearl, Poſſeſſions, and Money, and that the authority of the <hi>Pope</hi> is to make war, to break truce, to break oaths, and to aſſoyl from obedience, and of the Houſe of Prayer to make a den of Theeves; and ſo the <hi>Pope</hi> can depoſe a <hi>Biſhop</hi> without cauſe; and <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> could cut off <hi>Doctor John Huit</hi> his head by the ſame rule.

                  <p>Another Error in Laws you ſhall perceive in the great and marvellous hidden Miſteries of the Canons, which ſome <hi>Popes of Rome</hi> do fructifie, turning alſo the things which are ſpoken elſewhere in the holy Scripture, and ſometimes counterfeiting them, and with theſe their deviſes likening and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; from hence ſprung thoſe <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance,</hi> as <hi>Dr. Owen</hi> calls it, of the Bible, and of the Canons.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170561:94"/>
The learned <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> gives a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry full and ſatisfactory account of it out of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> writings, and doth clearly evidence, that the meaning was not this; that the beaſt was guilty of a crime, and had violated a Law, and therefore was to be condemned, and put to death; but it was in order to the happineſs and welfare of men: for <hi>Beſtia cum homine concumbens,</hi> was to be ſton'd; partly becauſe it was the occaſion of ſo foul a fact, and ſo fatal puniſhment unto man: and partly that the ſight and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the object might not repeat ſo prodigious a crime in the thoughts of men, nor receive the memory of it, nor continue the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of him that dyed for it.

But now there are ſome evils ſo exceſſively evil, as that they cannot but be forbidden, I ſhall only name this one, <hi>Odium Dei,</hi> for a being to hate the Creator and cauſe of its being, If it were poſſible for this not to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden; it were poſſible for it to be Lawful; for <hi>ubi nulla Lex, ibi praevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio:</hi> where there is no Law there's no <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>; where there's no Rule, ther's no <hi>Anomaly;</hi> if there were no prohibition of this, it would not be ſin to do it, But that to hate God ſhould not be a ſin, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve a whole heape of Contradictions: ſo that this evill is ſo full of evil, as that it cannot but be forbidden; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is an evil in order of nature before the prohibition of it: beſides as the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> love to ſpeak, <hi>Eſſentiae re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ſunt immutabiles,</hi> Eſſences neither ebbe nor flow, but have in themſelves a perpetuall unity and Identity. And all ſuch properties as flow and bubble up
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170561:102"/>
from beings, are conſtant and unvariable; but if they could be ſtopt in their Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet that ſtate would be violent, and not at all conatural to ſuch a ſubject.</p>
                  <p n="57">57. So that grant only the being of Man, and you cannot but grant this alſo, that there is ſuch a conſtant conveniency and Analogy, which ſome objects have with its Eſſence, as that it cannot but encline to them, and that there is ſuch an irreconciliable Diſconvenience, ſuch an eternal Antipathy between it and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther objects; as that it muſt ceaſe to be, what it is before it can come neare them.</p>
                  <p n="58">58. This Judge <hi>Glyn,</hi> termes a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall obligation and a Juſt foundation for Law; but now before all this can riſe up to the height and perfection of a Law, there muſt come a command from ſuperior powers, whence from will ſpring a Morall obligation alſo, and make up the formality of a Law: Therefore God himſelfe, for the brightning of his own Glory, for the better regulating of the world, for the maintaining of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170561:103"/>
ſuch a choice piece of his workman-ſhip as man is, he hath publiſht his Royall Command, &amp; proclaimed it by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Reaſon, which he hath planted in the being of man: which doth fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him of the righteouſneſſe, and goodneſſe and neceſſity of this Law, for the Materials of it; and of the validity and Authority of this Law, as it comes from the mind and will of his Creator. Neither is it any Eclipſe or diminution of the liberty of that firſt being; to ſay that there is ſome evill ſo foul and ill fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, as that it cannot but be forbidden by him; and that there is ſome good ſo fair and eminent, as that he cannot but command it.</p>
                  <p n="59">59. For as the Lawyers plead, <hi>Divina voluntas, licet ſimpliciter libera ſit ad extra, ex ſuppoſitione tamen unius Actus liberi, poteſt neceſſitari ad alium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="60">60. Though the will of God be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly free in reſpect of all his looks and glances towards the Creature, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding upon the voluntary and free
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170561:103"/>
precedency of one act, we may juſtly conceive him neceſſitated to another by vertue of that indiſſoluble Connexion and concatenation between theſe two acts, which doth in a manner knit and unite them into one.</p>
                  <p n="61">61. Thus God hath an abſolute Liberty and choyce, whether he will make a promiſe or no, but if he hath made it, he cannot but fulfil it. Thus he is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly free, whether he will reveale his mind or no; but if he will reveal it, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſpeak truth and manifeſt it as it is.</p>
                  <p n="62">62. God had the very ſame liberty whether he would Create a world or no, but if he would Create it, and keep it in its Comlineſſe and proportion, he muſt then have a vigilant and providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ttiall eye over it; And if he will provide for it, he cannot but have a perfect and indefective providence agreeable to his owne wiſdom, and goodneſſe, and being, ſo that if he will create ſuch a being as a man, ſuch a Rationall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture furniſht with ſufficient knowledge
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170561:104"/>
to diſcern between ſome good and ſome evil: and if he will ſupply it with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable concourſe in its operations, he cannot then but prohibit ſuch Acts as are intrinſecally prejudicial and detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to the being of it: neither can he but command ſuch Acts as are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to its preſervation and Welfare.</p>
                  <p n="63">63. God therefore when from all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity in his glorious thoughts he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived the being of man, he did alſo with his piercing eye ſee into all convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies &amp; diſconveniencies, which would be in reference to ſuch a being: and by his eternal Law did reſtrain and determine it to ſuch Acts as ſhould be advantagious to it, which in his wiſe <hi>Oeconomy</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, he publiſht to man by the voice of a <hi>Reaſon,</hi> by the mediation of this natural Law.</p>
                  <p n="64">64. Whence it is, that every violation of this <hi>Idea of the Law</hi> is not only an injury to mans being, but <hi>ultra nativam rei malitiam</hi> (as the Lawyers plead) it is alſo a vertual and interpretative contempt of that ſupream Law-giver, who out of ſo much wiſdom, and love, and goodneſs,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170561:104"/>
did thus bind man to his own happineſs. So much then as man doth ſtart aſide and apoſtatize from this Law, to ſo much miſery and puniſhment doth he expoſe himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="65">65. Though it be not neceſſary, <hi>That the Idea of the Law</hi> ſhould diſcover the full extent and meaſure of that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is due to the Breakers of this Law: for to the Nature of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Non requiritur ut praecognita ſit poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, ſed ut fiat actus dignus tali poena,</hi> the Counſellors and Atturneyes both will acknowledge this principle.</p>
                  <p n="67">67. For as <hi>Numenius Appionus</hi> hath it, <hi>Sequitur reatus ex intrinſeca condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione culpae, ita ut licet poena per legem non ſit determinata, Arbitrio tamen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petentis judicis puniri poſſit;</hi> Yet the <hi>Idea of the Law</hi> will reveal and diſcloſe thus much, That a being totally dependent upon another, eſſentially ſubordinate and ſubject to it, muſt alſo be accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to it for every provocation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion; And for the violation of ſo good a Law, which he hath ſet it, and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170561:105"/>
for the ſinning againſt ſuch admirable Providence and Juſtice that ſhines out upon it, muſt be liable to ſuch puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as that glorious Law-giver ſhall judge fit for ſuch offences; who is ſo full of Juſtice, that he cannot, and ſo great in goodneſs, that he will not puniſh a Creature above its deſert. And thus have I cleared one hundred Paragraphs, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping you will <hi>crown the King</hi> according to his deſerts, that my <hi>Idea</hi> may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, that the King, Parliament, Prieſt and People may live happily, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="68">68. And there was never any partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-Wall between the Eſſence of King <hi>Charles</hi> and the <hi>Parliament.</hi> Now the Law of Nature is founded in Eſſentials; And that which is diſconvenient to that rational Nature, which is in a Cavileir, is as oppoſite and diſagreeable to the ſame Nature in a <hi>Parliamentier, Round-head, Preſbyterian, Anabaptiſt, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi> and <hi>Quaker:</hi> as that good which is ſuitable and proportionable to a <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Cavileir</hi> in his rational being, is every way as intrinſecal to the welfare of a Parliamentier Round-head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170561:105"/>
doth not differ eſſentially from him: ſo likewiſe for the promulgation of this Law, being it doth equally, concern them both: It is alſo by my <hi>Idea of the Law</hi> equally publiſht and manifeſted to them both.</p>
                  <p n="69">69. The <hi>Extent of the Idea of the Law,</hi> I ſhall laſtly manifeſt in theſe thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Paragraphs, and ſo conclude; there are ſtampt and printed upon the being of man, ſome clear and undelible princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ſome firſt and alphabetical Notions: by putting together of which it can ſpell the nature of my <hi>Jdea of the Law,</hi> there is ſcatter'd in the ſoul of man ſome ſeeds of the <hi>Divine Idea,</hi> which till it with a vigorous Pregnancy, with a multiplying fruitfullneſſe; So that it brings forth a numerous and ſparkling Poſterity of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary Notions, which make for the Crowning and encompaſſing of the Soul with happineſs.</p>
                  <p n="70">70. All the freſh ſprings of Common and fountaine Notions are in the Soul of man, for the watering of his Eſſence, for the refreſhing of this heavenly Plant, This <hi>Arbor inverſa,</hi> this

encloſed being, this Garden of God.</p>
                  <p n="71">71. And though the wickedneſſe of man may ſtop the pleaſant moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the cleare and Chriſtalline Progreſs of the fountain, yet they cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the firſt riſing, the bubbling en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors of it.

And the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it inviolable. Now theſe firſt and Radicall principles are wound up in ſome ſuch ſhort bottoms as theſe: <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num eſt appetendum, malum eſt fugiendum; Beatitudo eſt quaerenda: Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris,</hi> And Reaſon thus <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="74">74. Diſcourſe is the uſuall Inlet of errour, and too oftengives an open admiſſion, and courteous entertainment to ſuch falſities as come diſguiſed in a Syllogiſtical form, which by their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarious windings and gradual inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, twine about ſome weake under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings: yet in the Nature of the thing it ſelfe, it is impoſſible to collect an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour out of a truth, as it is to gather

the blackeſt night, out of the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſun-ſhine, or the fowleſt wickedneſs out of the pureſt goodneſſe. A conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion therefore that is built upon the ſand, you may very well expects its fall, but that which is built upon the Rock is impregnable and immoveable.</p>
                  <p n="75">75. For if this <hi>Idea of the Law,</hi> ſhould not extend it ſelfe ſo far, as to oblige men to an accurate obſervation of that, which is a remove or two diſtant from firſt principles, it would then prove extreamly defective in ſome ſuch precepts, as do moſt intimately and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſly conduce to the welfare and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of an intellectuall being.</p>
                  <p n="76">76. The <hi>Idea of the Law,</hi> as it is thus brancht forth, doth bind in <hi>foro conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiae,</hi> for as that noble Author <hi>Des Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> ſpeakes very well in this, Naturall conſcience it is <hi>centrum notitiarum com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munium,</hi> and it is a kinde of <hi>ſenſus commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> in reſpect of the inward faculties, and that other in reſpect of the outward ſenſes.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170561:107"/>
of the ſoul, by the beating and Motion of which, the ſtate and temper of men is diſcernable: The Apoſtle thus felt the <hi>Heathens pulſe,</hi> and found their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences ſometimes accuſing them, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times making <hi>Apology</hi> for them, yet there's a great deal of difference between the <hi>Law of Conſcience</hi> and the <hi>Morall Law,</hi> for as the <hi>Lawyers</hi> plead, it is <hi>Dictamen practicum in particulari,</hi> it is a proſecution and application of this <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Idea of the Law,</hi> as providence is of that <hi>Divine Idea of the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="77">77. Nay conſcience ſometimes doth embrace only the ſhadow of a Law, and doth engage men, though erroneouſly, to the obſervation of that which was never dictated by any juſt legiſlative power, nor is it content to glance only at whats to come, but <hi>Janus</hi> like it has a double Aſpect; and ſo looks back to whats paſt, as to call men to a ſtrict account for every violation of this Law.</p>
                  <p n="78">78. Which Law is ſo accurate as to oblige men, not only <hi>ad actum</hi> but <hi>ad mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum</hi> alſo: it lookes as well to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170561:108"/>
form and manner, as to the Materiality and bulk of outward Actions: for every being owes thus much kindneſs and curteſie to it ſelfe, not only to put forth ſuch acts as are eſſential and intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal to its own welfare; but alſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in them, and to fulfil them with all poſſible freeneſſe and Alacrity, with the greateſt intenſneſſe and complacency, ſelfe love alone might eaſily conſtraine men to this naturall obedience. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Lawes indeed reſt ſatisfied with a viſible and externall obedience; but natures Law darts it ſelfe into the moſt intimate Eſſentialls, and lookes for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment there.</p>

You know that amongſt the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts only ſuch Acts are eſteemed <hi>Actus Humani</hi> that are <hi>Actus voluntarii:</hi> when my Natural <hi>Idea</hi> hath tuned a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall being, ſhe expects that every ſtring, every faculty ſhould ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſound forth his praiſe.</p>

                  <p n="81">81. Nay the precepts of <hi>this Idea of the Law,</hi> are ſo potent and triumphant, as that ſome acts, which rebel againſt it, become not only <hi>illicit</hi> but <hi>irrite,</hi> as both the <hi>Counſellors and Atturneys</hi> obſerve, they are not only irregularities, but meer nullities, and that either <hi>ob defectum po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtatis &amp; incapacitatem materiae,</hi> as if one ſhould goe about to give the ſame thing to two ſeverall perſons; the ſecond Donation is a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>non entity,</hi> or elſe <hi>propter perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuam

and his <hi>Meſſengers</hi> and <hi>Planets</hi> meet and oppoſe wonderfully. In 1642. <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> fell out about Subjects Rebellion againſt their <hi>King.</hi> And it may be obſerved, that ſince <hi>Church-men</hi> dabled in <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques,</hi> and <hi>Stateſ-men</hi> in <hi>Divinity, Law</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> have been ſtill ſubjected to the ſword, and in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, thoſe ſame excurſions and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterate Mixtures, are but the workings of a party already in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards that end. He that deſignes a change of Government, muſt begin by impoſing a deluſion upon the people: And whatſoever is neceſſary to his purpoſe, muſt be accommodated to their humour.</p>
                  <p>The Pulpit by theſe gloſſes, and puzling diſtinctions under the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of conditionate obedience, ſuggeſting liberty, couſens the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude into a Rebellion; Oaths &amp; Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants are but the Jugglers-knots,
<pb facs="tcp:170561:113"/>
faſt or looſe, as the Prieſt pleaſes. The weaker ſort being thus prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and poyſoned by a ſeditious Clergy; 'tis then the Stateſ-mans part to puſh thoſe mutinous inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into action, and to divide the cauſe betwixt Conſcience and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, the better to involve all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts in the Quarrel under the Maſque of <hi>Piety,</hi> and publickneſs of ſpirit of <hi>holy men</hi> and <hi>Patriots:</hi> the <hi>Crafty</hi> cheat the <hi>ſimple,</hi> engaging by thoſe ſpecious pretences the raſh miſ-guiding people (with good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, but wanting care and skill) in Sacriledge and Treaſon. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed now all the <hi>planets</hi> are retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade, except the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> which ſometimes are eclipſ'd, and dart down theſe influences upon the earth.</p>
                  <p>This was the very Root, and this hath been the proneſs of our evils; for under the Notion of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb facs="tcp:170561:114"/>
the ſafety and honour of the <hi>King, The fundamental Lawes,</hi> and Freedomes of the people, the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges</hi> of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> &amp;c. The Kingdome was gulled into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with an ambitious and ſciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical faction: the main pretence was the Aſſertion of the Subjects le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Rights againſt the grand prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives: And that directed only to the limitation of an intended arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power, that regulation of ſuch &amp; ſuch miſgovernments, and all this ſaving their Allegiance to his <hi>ſacred Majeſty,</hi> whoſe Perſon, Crown and Dignity, they had ſo often ſworn deeply to maintain.</p>
                  <p>This was a bait ſo popular, it could not fail of drawing in a party, and that produced a Warre. The former ſtory of the Quarrel is little to my purpoſe: The Logique of it leſs, How by the ſame authority of Text and Law, both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>People</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:170561:114"/>
could be juſtified againſt the other: I meddle not, let it ſuffice, that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter back't with a Comment</hi> few years before threw down, after ſix years conflict, a vaſt profuſion of blood and Treaſure, the <hi>King</hi> a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and his whole party ſcattered and diſarmed: The <hi>Commons</hi> found themſelves diſpoſ'd to end our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and paſſed a Vote to treat with his <hi>Majeſty</hi> in order to a ſettlement: This met with little oppoſition, for all the <hi>planets</hi> were then in <hi>Trine,</hi> except <hi>Mars,</hi> his people, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gorged themſelves already up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the publick ruine, were not yet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied without their <hi>Soveraigns blood, the death of Monarchy it ſelf,</hi> and the ſubjecting of a tame &amp; ſlaviſh peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to a Conventicle of Regicides; there were not many of ſo deep a tincture, but what theſe few could not effect by number, they did by force: for by the malice of mutual
<pb facs="tcp:170561:115"/>
                     <hi>Aſpects,</hi> the <hi>planets</hi> ſhowered down ſix moneths before: then Sir <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe Waller, Pride</hi> and <hi>Hewſon</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by this influence, upon the ſixth of <hi>December,</hi> 1648. they ſeized and impriſoned 41. of the <hi>Commons houſe,</hi> clapp'd guards upon all Paſſes leading to it: ſome 60. more were given in upon a Liſt to thoſe that kept the door with an expreſſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from ſeveral leading mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to oppoſe their entrance: about 40. more withdrew for fear of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, their crime was only the carrying of a Vote for peace alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy mentioned the day before: This action was ſo erroneous, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Contrivers of it were aſhamed to own it, transferring that upon the Army-Officers, which was done by their own appointment. They paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed however a formal diſallowance of the violence, and ordered their diſcharge, which yet the Officers
<pb facs="tcp:170561:115"/>
refuſed upon a combination now moſt evident; obſerve,</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Comet</hi> and a <hi>grand Eclipſe of the Sun</hi> alters the matter: for that which they told me in 48, was an Act of the Army-Officers, In 59. they call a Judgement of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and they juſtifie and continue that very ſecluſion, by a Vote of <hi>Jan.</hi> 5.59. which they themſelves condemned and diſcharged by ſeveral Orders in <hi>Decemb.</hi> 48. The particulars of theſe tranſactions by Sir <hi>Michael Heydon</hi> are excellently delivered. And thus you ſee <hi>how God by the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets ſhoots down his Angry ſword, and how they are now all ſet upon revenge, their influence is furious:</hi> and ſo will continue untill <hi>the King be crowned in</hi> England, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will now return to the great teſt of the ſpirits, and deſignes of the ſeveral parties and Members of the Houſe, and from that Judgement,
<pb facs="tcp:170561:116"/>
and diſcrimination of perſons and humours, we may learn ſeaſonably to provide againſt after-claps: This Blow brake the houſe of Commons into three-peices, one party adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Vote oppoſed the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, declared againſt it, claimed from time to time their own and the peoples Rights, pleaded the Covenant and their Declarations, and ſtood it out. The ſecond ſort, was not prepared for Martyrdome, a kind of Barnacle, neither fiſh nor fleſh: this was a party that flew at firſt, but ſoon retracted: Headed again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and went along for company: My charity perſwades me well of diverſe of them, and that they mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, rather in hopes to moderate the reſt, then in deſign to ſtrengthen them. A party rather weak and paſſive then malicious: But nothing can excuſe thoſe ſons of <hi>Belial,</hi> the perjured Remnant; no, nor expreſs
<pb facs="tcp:170561:116"/>
them: beſide their Oaths and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, they have above an hundred times in printed Declarations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the very thought of what they have ſince executed. Read the <hi>exact Collections,</hi> We are (ſay they) ſo far from altering the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental conſtitution and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Kingdome by <hi>King, Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons:</hi> that we have only deſired, that with the conſent of the <hi>King,</hi> ſuch powers may be ſettled in the two houſes, without which we can have no aſſurance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are the very words of their Declaration, <hi>April</hi> 17. 1646. pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by the Houſe of Commons alone, towards the end of the War, and moſt remarkably entituled, <hi>A Declaration of their True intentions, concerning the antient Government of the Nation, and ſecuring the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all arbitrary Government.</hi>

And thus in <hi>April</hi> 1653, he ſhewed
<pb facs="tcp:170561:117"/>
himſelfe how diſpleaſed he was at the <hi>Kings death,</hi> and revenged he was upon the <hi>Parliament.</hi> It were worth the while to enquire into the good they did us, during that ſix years ſeſſion, but that I leave to their <hi>Mercurius Needham;</hi> Nor ſhall I far examine the Protectors Reign; by whoſe advice, by what aſſiſtance, or by what Lawes he ruled, how many of our late Republicans for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate themſelves, and ſwore Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to a ſingle perſon: how many things like Parliaments he diſperſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (for the Army hath got a jadiſh trick, and will not leave it) It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, at laſt he died in deſpight of <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Poets, Owen</hi> and <hi>Wythers,</hi> the former telling him from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he ſhould ſcape that fit; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther telling us ſo needleſly: His <hi>Highnesſ,</hi> having other things to think on, left his Succeſſor doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, till (as they ſay) his Secretary

(then, one of ours now) with <hi>John Owen</hi> (his prophetique Confeſſor) ſwore his ſon <hi>Richard</hi> into the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector-ſhip; but he, good Gentleman, did not much hurt, but peaceably reſigned to <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and <hi>Diſborough,</hi> (not a word of the <hi>King of the Saints,</hi> for he deſires to be private) and they quite at a loſs, for want of Brains ond courage, call'd in the Fag-end of the old houſe to their Aſſiſtance; ſo that the Members which deſcended in <hi>April</hi> 53. roſe again, and aſcended upon the 7. of <hi>May,</hi> 59. But ſtill the <hi>Planets</hi> are oppoſite as God would have it, which make the Members act as impetuouſly as ever; Then they were once again unſeated by the Army, as the <hi>Planets predict</hi> and <hi>Geomantick Genii:</hi> The 13. of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> laſt the Influences took effect, and then the Committee of Safety was inveſted with the ſupream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, (it is but a ſlippery title
<pb facs="tcp:170561:118"/>
that of the ſword) This change gave his <hi>Excellency</hi> the <hi>Lord Monk</hi> occaſion to remember his love to the <hi>King,</hi> and to ſhew his Charity to his <hi>Native Countrey:</hi> by whoſe curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity and Conduct, the honeſt and ſuffering party was relieved, and the <hi>Phanatique Army</hi> diſperſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blood; Hereupon the Souldiery tack'd about once again, lamenting their back-ſlidings: and on the 26. of <hi>December,</hi> the good old cauſe men re-enthron'd themſelves more eagerly now then formerly againſt the re-admiſſion of the ſecluded Members. This barbarous and arbitrary proceeding put the whole Nation upon a neceſsity of procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a <hi>full and free Parliament:</hi> to wch. end they purpoſed modeſtly &amp; fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the reſtoring the excluded mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and filling of the houſe: or elſe the liberty of a New and legal choice: for bringing letters, Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Pye</hi> and <hi>Major Faicher</hi> were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned.
<pb facs="tcp:170561:119"/>
This was an Inſolence too groſs, to do much miſchief but to themſelves: Are theſe the men (the people cryed) <hi>That put the King to death only upon pretence of a deſign, to erect &amp; uphold in himſelf an unlimited and Tyrannical power,</hi> to rule accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Will, and to overthrow the rights and liberties of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; yea, to take away, and make void the foundations thereof, and of all redreſs and remedy of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government, which by the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental conſtitutions of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom were reſolved on the peoples behalf, in the right and power of frequent and ſucceſſive Parliaments: theſe are the words of the charge;</p>
                  <p>That which was <hi>Treaſon in our lawfull Prince,</hi> how comes it to be Law now with theſe Fellowes? <hi>They took away the Kings life, for but diſcourſing the very thing they act:</hi> and we are to be impriſoned and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
<pb facs="tcp:170561:119"/>
for asking only that they ſwore they fought for: No; they are a Pack of <hi>Knaves,</hi> they cut off his head, that they might rule themſelves: The plot was grown ſo rank, the common people ſmelt it, and without more ado, aſſociated to free themſelves from an infamous and perpetual Bondage, witneſs that Union in their declarations, both of Demand and Reſolutions: againſt the Equity whereof, no man hath hitherto pretended the leaſt objection, the <hi>ſupream Trifle,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving an univerſal Application to the General in his paſſage, and all ſpeaking the ſame ſenſe; finding withall, that his Excellency ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, till he might hear both parties: and conſcious to themſelves of no imaginable reaſon to oppoſe: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſeeing themſelves declined and hated, nay, endangered by a peremptory Agreement of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:170561:120"/>
They did at laſt moſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly deſcend to promiſe us a full Repreſentative: but no ſecluded Members to be admitted, nor in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect any other then <hi>Phanatiques.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His <hi>Excellency</hi> well weighing what was reaſoned, <hi>pro &amp; contra,</hi> made way for the Return of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded members. This Juſtice brake the neck of a Deſign juſt then on foot. This is the ſhort on't, the people were to be held at gaze, in expectation of a further ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, till thoſe Troops which the back-ſide had ordered to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſhould have ſeized all the conſiderable perſons of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: nay, they are impudent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to tempt the <hi>General</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into a complication with them, but he was too diſcreet: not to diſtinguiſh where to obſerve, and where to leave them, In fine the <hi>Stars</hi> and <hi>Planets</hi> above, and the
<pb facs="tcp:170561:120"/>
Rulers and Ideas below in their Characters and Figures of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy and Geomancy Teleſmatical arreſted, do predict a check to their impetuous madneſs and brutiſh fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                  <p>Next to our gratitude to heaven, let us have a care, not to be wanting in point of prudence to our ſelves; nothing undoes us but ſecurity, we ſee, who are our friends, and who are our enemies, whom we may truſt, and whom we muſt not, we have paid dear for our experience, and ſure we have a tittle to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of it, we muſt look back, and learn from thence the meaning of the future.</p>
                  <p>It is a tedious while this Nation hath been toſſed betwixt two facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: One in the Army, the other in the Council; both well enough agreed to deſtroy us; but jealous ſtill one of the other, as <hi>Don</hi> ſaith
<pb facs="tcp:170561:121"/>
of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> concerning his Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titor in Hell: He was content he ſhould be damned, but loth he ſhould govern; that's all the Quarrel. The Vizor of Religion is thrown aſide long ſince; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle cheats the Souldier this day, and he falls upon the Rump the next. In ſhort, they cheat the one the other at the publique charge: they may ſnarle where they pleaſe, but they bite none but us, and at the worſt forgive their fellow-thieves for robbing honeſt men: this hath been their practice near this dozen years. Are we not yet convinc'd, that it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it ſhould be otherwiſe, while the ſame people govern us with the ſame army, and bound up by no other Lawes then their own Will? I do not preſs any reſiſtance now, but certainly a readineſs to protect honeſter men in caſe of an Attempt,
<pb facs="tcp:170561:121"/>
were not amiſs: we ſee how dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily they have uſed the General, and how unworthily their Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have laboured the Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a direct Tumult: And all this in order to a new violence upon the houſe. We ſee what juggling is uſed in the <hi>Militia,</hi> as foyſting in falſe Liſts to caſt the ſtrength of the Nation into the hands of mean and factious perſons; what indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry to hold us ſtill unſetled, by throwing in impertinent and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſcruples, to divert at the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt, if not diſturb the long deſired <hi>Peace, and Protestant Religion, being eſtabliſhed in the true ſenſe of the Church of England</hi> we pray for: He that hath either <hi>honor</hi> in his <hi>blood,</hi> or <hi>honesty</hi> in <hi>heart,</hi> is reproached with a <hi>King</hi> in his Belly: then for the Qualifications, theſe goodly Squires would have thruſt upon us; are they not pleaſant? one man of
<pb facs="tcp:170561:122"/>
forty ſhall be allowed to vote, or ſit; and the other thirty nine muſt call that a <hi>Free Parliament,</hi> and ſwear it repreſents the people. We are not ſo blind yet, nor ſo forgetfull, as not to ſee and know ſome Foxes, and ſome Aſſes in the medly. All are not Saints we call ſo: We do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member who they were that ruled in 48. and we are ſenſible what they would do ſtill, if they had power: we know who brought in, who: but the Markets raiſed; our heads will not off now at fifty ſhillings a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, as formerly. Laſtly, let the <hi>General, the ſecluded Members, and the honeſt Souldiers live long, happily and beloved, and let the reſt take their fortune,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I write not this out of an itch of ſcribling, or to ſupport a faction: my duty bids me write: nor do I love to ſpend time in Complement; The Readers wiſdome, or the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
<pb facs="tcp:170561:122"/>
weakneſs is not the Queſtion. The Nation is in diſtreſs by <hi>Tyranny,</hi> and every honeſt Engliſhman muſt lend his hand to ſave it: Nay, that muſt be done quickly too, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly: Delay is mortal. Can any thing be more ridiculous, then to ſtand formalizing in a caſe, where it is impoſſible to be too early, or too zealous. The event of things takes up our thoughts, more then the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of them. What Newes, more then what remedy: as if it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us rather to know, whoſe fooles and ſlaves we ſhall be next, then to be ſuch no longer. That which compleats the wonder, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ſight is, that the miſeries we ſuffer, were before hand, as eaſily to be foreſeen and prevented, as they are now to be felt. And we only look backward, to take a perfect meaſure of the future: ſo obvious and formal is the method, that leads
<pb facs="tcp:170561:123"/>
to our Deſtruction, if we were not in love with beggery and bondage, and ſubject to Tyrants, let us all at laſt bethink our ſelves of freedome, and from a due enquiry into the <hi>Idea of Tyranny,</hi> (that is the riſe, and growth, and preſent State of our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities) learn to be happy for the time to come. <hi>This Idea of Tyranny,</hi> men are arreſted and ruined, upon ſuſpition of debt: impriſoned to death in a plea of treſpaſs: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuſpition of Treaſon, men are deſtroyed without reaſon, and never know at whoſe ſuit they are arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or if they do, they know not the Plantiffe: And for the latter, they never knew their Accuſers, nor any relief but deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Others are taken upon ſuſpition of fellony, and are ſtarved to death in priſon; and this is the <hi>Idea of Tyranny.</hi>

having (as it was conceived) been by many Volumes of our learned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſo cleerly unfolded, that it was not credible, that either the whole body of the old, or the Caprice of any new-far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled fancy, ſhould be able to ſtagger the foundation was laid for it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But a long peace accompanied with too great a felicity, bred ſuch a wantonneſs in our ſouls, that we could not be ſatisfied with that was generally profeſt and practiced; forms, rites and ceremonies become nauſeous to our dainty ſtomacks; they relliſhed too much of Antiquity, Superſtition and Idolatry, and we muſt have ſome thing of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty to pleaſe the guſts of our Palats: this in ſucceſſion of time attained to ſo vaſt a growth, that at laſt like evil weeds it choakt the Plants ſet by the Induſtry of the Gardner, and diſputed the propriety of the patron.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thus armed with the ſtrong zeal of Religion we hurry into a pernicious Warre, make piety the cloak of our Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and therewith charm ſimple Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots

                  <p n="4">4. By the ſeverity of our procedures, we become formidable to loyal ſouls: by our aſſidual promiſes of Reformation, we enſlave the Wills of Idolaters, who hood-winkt with our ſpecious pretences, vigorouſly ſupport the weakneſs of our cauſe, and by frequent victories we le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate that right, which no former age could, or ever did make claim unto.</p>

Our peacefull Soveraign was held too improper to ſit at the ſterne of this ſtern Nation, his clemency was too benigne, his ſobriety too regular, his Juſtice too merciful, his converſation too familiar, acceſs too facile; he had not the gift of Hipocriſie to ſcrew himſelfe into the credit of a <hi>Zelot,</hi> he wanted the <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian auſteritie</hi> to check the frowardneſs of our inſolence, he was to ill furniſht with viciousneſſe too countenance our horid villanies, In fine he lacked Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſſe to curbe the impudence of our Rebellion.</p>
